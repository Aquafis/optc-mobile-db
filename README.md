# Info
Mobile android app to access optc-db.github.io

This project is born to give people a fast way to search an OPTC character stats, by accessing the already existing database http://optc-db.github.io.
So far, the project is still in initial state, the UI is simple and contains a list with the characters, a bar to sort by name, type or stars, a box where you can type the name to search for, and the character details that pops up when you press on a character.

Hope to bring more cool features in the future.
