Mobile android app to access optc-db.github.io

This project is born to give people a fast way to search an OPTC character stats, by accessing the already existing database http://optc-db.github.io.
So far, the project is still in initial state, the UI is simple and contains a list with the characters, a bar to sort by name, type or stars, a box where you can type the name to search for, and the character details that pops up when you press on a character. Plans for the future are a customizable filter query (filter by type, stars, class, etc.) and the possibility to access the database offline and update it when connected to internet.

Hope to bring more cool features in the future.

# How to install
Either download source code and compile with your own android compiler to build your own APK, or download the latest APK built, and install (enable unknown sources first) from the [Release](https://github.com/paolo-optc/optc-mobile-db/releases/tag/1.0) section!

# Credits

Most of the work done for this app is from the people at optc-db.github.io. They created the database, so they made the ugly work. I only created the mobile interface, and I didn't spend so much time on it. So if you have to thank someone, thank the guys mentioned before.
